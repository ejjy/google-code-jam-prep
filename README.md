## Google Code Jam Prep

Decided to start practising for Google Code Jam by doing their recommended questions found here:

[http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html](http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html)

I've answered a good chunk of them, and my framework for solution code is evolving steadily. The Ruby source is further along, but I'm going to be moving back to Java and develop something similar.

Both time to find a solution as well as running time of your program are considered in this contest. It appears that no one in the later rounds used dynamic languages at all. Although there could be other explanations for this, I've decided not to take the chance and use a speedier language in later rounds.

Expect this repo to be updated this as I go over the next few months. For other interested contest participators, I've found this link that I'm hoping will come in handy:

It contains breakdowns of winners, losers, what questions they got and didn't, what they wrote it in, links to source code, etc.
